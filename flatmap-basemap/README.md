# Flatmap Basemap Profile

This basemap profile is based on [OpenMapTiles](https://github.com/openmaptiles/openmaptiles) v3.12.2.
See [README.md](../README.md) in the parent directory for instructions on how to run.

## Differences from OpenMapTiles

- `transportation_name` layer does not abbreviate road names yet
- `poi` layer missing the `agg_stop` tag
- Paths are visible at z13 in `transportation` and `transportation_name` layers instead of z14 in OpenMapTiles, to
  revert this behavior set `--transportation-z13-paths=false`
- `brunnel` tag is excluded from `transportation_name` layer to avoid breaking apart long `transportation_name`
  lines, to revert this behavior set `--transportation-name-brunnel=true`

## Code Layout

[Generate.java](./src/main/java/com/onthegomap/flatmap/basemap/Generate.java) generates code in
the [generated](./src/main/java/com/onthegomap/flatmap/basemap/generated) package from an OpenMapTiles tag in GitHub:

- [OpenMapTilesSchema](./src/main/java/com/onthegomap/flatmap/basemap/generated/OpenMapTilesSchema.java)
  contains an interface for each layer with constants for the name, attributes, and their allowed values
- [Tables](./src/main/java/com/onthegomap/flatmap/basemap/generated/Tables.java)
  contains a record for each table that OpenMapTiles [imposm3](https://github.com/omniscale/imposm3) configuration
  generates (along with the tag-filtering expression) so layers can listen on instances of those records instead of
  doing the tag filtering and parsing themselves

The [layers](./src/main/java/com/onthegomap/flatmap/basemap/layers) package contains a port of the SQL logic to generate
each layer from OpenMapTiles. Layers define how source features (or parsed imposm3 table rows) map to vector tile
features, and logic for post-processing tile geometries.

[BasemapProfile](./src/main/java/com/onthegomap/flatmap/basemap/BasemapProfile.java)
dispatches source features to layers and merges the results.

[BasemapMain](./src/main/java/com/onthegomap/flatmap/basemap/BasemapMain.java) is the main driver that registers source
data and output location.

## Regenerating Code

To run `Generate.java`, use [scripts/regenerate-openmaptiles.sh](../scripts/regenerate-openmaptiles.sh) script with the
OpenMapTiles release tag:

```bash
./scripts/regenerate-openmaptiles.sh v3.12.2
```

Then follow the instructions it prints for reformatting generated code.
